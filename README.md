## Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

Statically typed programming languages perform type check at compile time i.e if the script contains an error it will fail to compile until the error is fixed. It also requires that you declare the data type of variables before usage e.g Java and C.

while

Dynamically typed programming languages perform type checking at runtime and you do not need to declare the data type of variables before every use e.g Javascript and Python.

## Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

null is a value, it can be assigned to a variable. It is a way we can explicitly say that a variable has no value i.e the variable doesnt have a value yet.

while

Undefined is a type that is given to a variable automatically when they have not yet been defined.
